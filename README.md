XHP classes for Twitter's Bootstrap project
===========================================

Requirements:
- HHVM with Eval.EnableHipHopSyntax=1 set (EnableXHP isn't enough currently)
- Composer

This is an in-progress hackathon project; it's useful as an example, and hopefully will be useful for real use in the near future - however, it's not yet stable.
